# Curriculum

This is a way to make a "online curriculum". My inspiracion is Lucas Montano's website.

## How?

I'm using fetch api to consuming the markdown files located here (repository).

To make this run well, i use Mark lib (CDN).

## How much this is easy

A LOT!

- create your html document
- select a div
- render into this div the content fetched from markdown (inside the mark)
- success

using markdown, you can find a enviroment more easy than html.
